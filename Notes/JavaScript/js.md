# JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript6)


## What is a Scripting Language?
All scripting languages are programming languages. The scripting language do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. This is basically a language where instructions are written for a run time environment.
<br><br>


## Advantages of Scripting Languages
1. Easy learning
2. Fast Editing
3. Interactivity
4. Functionality
<br><br>


## Applications of Scripting Languages
1. To automate certain task in a program.
2. They are used in system administration. For ex: Shell, Perl, Python, etc.
3. It is used in Games application and Multimedia.
4. It is used to create plugins and extensions for existing applications.
5. Scripting languages are used in Web Applications. It is used in server side as well as client side. Server side scripting languages are: JavaScript, PHP, Perl, etc. and client side scripting languages are: JavaScript, VBScript, etc.

## Features of JavaScript
It is a lightwight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the developement of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for **Client-Side** developments as well as **Server-side** developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects like - Array, Date, Math and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures and statements.

## JavaScript Code Structure
1. **Statements** - They are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions. For example: Here we split "Hello World" into two alerts:
> alert('Hello'); 
alert('World');

2. **Semicolons** - A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. But it generally marks the end of a statement.

3. **Comments** - As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why. Comments can be put into any palce in a script. They dont't affect its execution because the engine simply ingores them. 
    - **One-line comments** start with two forward slash characters `//`.
    - **Multi-line comments** start with a forward slash and an asterisk `/*` and end with an asterisk and a forward slash `*/`. 
    - Note: Nested comments are not supported!

4. **Whitespace and Line Breaks** - ES6 ignores spaces, tabs and newline that appear in programs. You can use them freely in your program to format and indent your code.

5. **JavaScrpt is Case Sensitive** - This means that JavaScript differentiates between the uppercase and the lowewrcase characters.
<br><br>


## ES6 Syntax
**Syntax** defines the set of rule for writing programs. Every language specification defines its own syntax. A JavaScript program can be composed of:
1. **Variables** -  Represents a named memory block that can store values for the program.
2. **Literals** - Represents constant/fixed values.
3. **Operators** - Symbols that define how the operands will be processed.
4. **Keywords** - Words that have a special meaning in the context of a language.
5. **Modules** - Represents code blocks that can be reused across different programs/scripts.
6. **Identifiers** - These are the names given to the elements in a program like: variables, functions, etc. The rules for identifiers are:
    - Identifiers can include both characters and digits.
    - Identifiers cannot begin with a digit.
    - Identifiers cannot include special symbols except for underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
    - Identifiers cannot be keywords.
    - Identifiers are case sensitive.
    - Identifiers cannot contain spaces.
<br><br>


## ES6 and Hoisting
The JavaScript engine, by default, moves declarations to the top. This feature is termed as **hoisting**. This feature applies to variables and functions. Hoisting allows JavaScript to use a component before it has been declared. However, the concept of hoisting does not apply to scripts that are run in the **Strict Mode** (The Strict Mode imposes a layer of constraint on JavaScript. It makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics.).
<br><br>


## Operators
An **expression** is a special kind of statement that evaluates to a value. Every expression is composed of:
- **Operands** - Represent the data.
- **Operator** - Defines how the operands will be processed to produce to produce a value.
JavaScript supports the following types of operators:
- Arithmetic operators
- Logical operators
- Relational operators
- Bitwise operators
- Assignment operators
- Ternary/conditional operators
- String operators
- Type operators (`typeof`)
- void operator (`void`)
- Spread operator (`...`)
<br><br>


## Decision Making
A conditional/decision-making construct evaluates a condition before the instructions are executed.
- if else statement
- switch case statement
<br><br>


## Where are Scripts Stored?
Scripts can be external or internal to your website and/or external or internal to your web pages. A script is a source file (of a scripting langauge) that is stored on an web server, within the same location as your web pages or a script can also be included as part of your web pages.<br>

There are three types of Scripts:
1. **Embedded or Internal** - the scripts are included within the HTML using script tags thourghout the HTML of the web page.
2. **Inline** - the script appear throughout the HTML of the web page - in the body elements.
3. **Linked or External** - the script are stored in a separate file external to all the web pages.

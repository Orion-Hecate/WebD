# JavaScript Built-ins


## Date
The **Date object** is a datatype built into the JavaScript language. Date objects are created with the `new Date()` as shown in the following syntax.
> new Date()
new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(dateString)
new Date(year, month, date[, hour, minute, second, millisecond])

*Note: The ECMAScript standard requires the Date object to be able to represent any date and time, to millisecond precision, within 100 million days before or after 1/1/1970. This is a range of plus or minus 273,785 years, so JavaScript can represent date and time till the year 275755.*

## Math
The math object provides you properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Unlike other global objects, **Math** is not a constructor. All the properties and methods of Math are static and can be called by using  Math as an object without creating it.
- **Math Constants**
- **Exponential Functions**
- **Logarithmic Functions**
- **Trignometric Functions**
- **Miscellaneous Algebraic Functions**
- **Math.random()** - The `Math.random()` function returns a **pseudorandom** number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

## RegExp
A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters. Regular Expressions are often abbreviated as "**regex**" or "**regexp**".
